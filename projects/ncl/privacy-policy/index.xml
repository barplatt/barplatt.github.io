                        market research purposes. We may contact you by email, phone, fax or
                        mail.&lt;/li&gt;

                        interests.&lt;/li&gt;
                        &lt;li&gt;We may provide your information to our third party partners for
                        marketing or promotional purposes.&lt;/li&gt;

                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Security&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    The information storage system we use is both secure and in compliance with
                    necessary state and federal laws and regulation. In the event that there is
                    unauthorized access of you data,&amp;nbsp;New Castle Living, its affiliates and
                    employees are not liable for any damage resulting from such unauthorized
                    access.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How we use cookies&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    A cookie is a small file which asks permission to be placed on your computer&#39;s
                    hard drive. Once you agree, the file is added and the cookie helps analyze web
                    traffic or lets you know when you visit a particular site. Cookies allow web
                    applications to respond to you as an individual. The web application can tailor
                    its operations to your needs, likes and dislikes by gathering and remembering
                    information about your preferences.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;We use traffic log cookies to identify which pages are being used. This
                    helps us analyze data about web page traffic and improve our website in order
                    to tailor it to customer needs. We only use this information for statistical
                    analysis purposes and then the data is removed from the system.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;Overall, cookies help us provide you with a better website, by enabling us
                    to monitor which pages you find useful and which you do not. A cookie in no way
                    gives us access to your computer or any information about you, other than the
                    data you choose to share with us.&lt;/p&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;You can choose to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically
                    accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline
                    cookies if you prefer. This may prevent you from taking full advantage of the
                    website.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
                    &lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Links to other websites&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;

                    cannot be responsible for the protection and privacy of any information which
                    you provide whilst visiting such sites and such sites are not governed by this
                    privacy statement. You should exercise caution and look at the privacy
                    statement applicable to the website in question.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;br&gt;
